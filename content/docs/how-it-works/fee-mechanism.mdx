description: Understanding Necta’s transparent, performance-based fee structure
---

Necta employs a performance-based fee model to align our interests with our users. Here’s how it works:

## No Deposit or Withdrawal Fees

-   Zero fees for deposits and withdrawals
-   No hidden charges or lock-up periods

## Performance-Based Fees

Our fee structure is simple and fair:

-   Fees are only applied to additional yield generated
-   Users pay only when earning more than baseline returns
-   Base yields go directly to users
-   Performance fees are automatically calculated and deducted

This ensures that Necta profits only when our users do, aligning our goals with yours.
