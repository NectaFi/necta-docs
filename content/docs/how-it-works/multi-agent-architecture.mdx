Necta’s multi-agent system consists of three specialized AI agents, each contributing to optimizing yield generation:

## 🔎 Sentinel Agent

The Sentinel Agent continuously performs critical tasks, including:

-   Scanning market conditions across multiple protocols
-   Monitoring lending and staking APYs
-   Tracking liquidity levels
-   Assessing risk factors
-   Monitoring wallet status and balances

This ensures the system remains up-to-date with the latest market dynamics and opportunities.

## 📝 Curator Agent

The Curator Agent is the strategic brain of the system, responsible for:

-   Evaluating data from the Sentinel Agent
-   Determining optimal allocation strategies
-   Generating execution tasks
-   Aligning actions with risk-adjusted return goals
-   Creating efficient transaction paths

## 🔑 Executor Agent

The Executor Agent handles all on-chain interactions, such as:

-   Executing transactions securely and efficiently
-   Managing swaps, deposits, and withdrawals
-   Optimizing gas usage
-   Ensuring transaction security

These agents work in a continuous feedback loop to ensure 24/7 optimization while maintaining both security and efficiency.
